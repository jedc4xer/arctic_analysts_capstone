Analysis Summary

    Owning a home is a long-term goal for many Americans, and the trends of recent years have
    caused many to question their abilitity to purchase a home as prices have increased rapidly.
    In this analysis, we looked at affordability specifically in New Jersey at the county level.
    We will use current house prices, the average mortgage interest rate, and forecasted Median Income
    to classify counties as affordable or not affordable.

    The factors that we considered for this analysis were:

    - Median Income
    - New Housing Permits
    - Average Mortgage Interest Rate
    - Median House Prices
    
    We were able to get current data for all of our variables except for Median Income, which was gathered
    from the US Census ACS and was last updated in 2019. In order to fill in the gaps, we will be using a 
    time-series model on the U.S. Income Data to get a forecast of current income levels.

    We are defining home affordability as when the monthly mortgage payment including the average property tax
    is less than or equal to 25% of a household's monthly median income given a 12% down-payment.

    A county will be considered affordable if a household making the median income will be able to 
    afford a home that is a median priced home in that county.
