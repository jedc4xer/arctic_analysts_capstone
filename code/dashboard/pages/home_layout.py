Owning a home is a long-term goal for many Americans, and the trends of recent years have caused many to question their abilitity for purchase a home as prices have increased rapidly. In this analysis, we looked at affordability specifically in New Jersey by at the county level. We will use current house prices, the average mortgage interest rate, and forecasted Median Income to classify counties as affordable or not affordable.

We were able to get current data for all of our variables except for Median Income, which was gathered from the US Census ACS and was last updated in 2019. In order to fill in the gaps, we will be using a time-series model on the U.S. Income Data to get a forecast of current income levels.
